# Terminal commands to run when pulling

1. After pulling, first make a new virtual environment in Backend yourself. cd into Backend and do \
"python -m venv venv" to make a new virtual environment. This is just good practice to prevent dependencies
from going beyond.


2. Now run .\venv\Script\activate to activate the virtual environment. You know it will work if you
see (venv) in front of your terminal directory


3. Now in the same backend directory, run pip install -r .\requirements.txt to get all the dependences on the project


4. You should be set, now run python ./main.py to run the FastAPI call
