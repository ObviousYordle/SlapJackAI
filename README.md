# Terminal commands to run when pulling

1. If you haven't already, first make a new virtual environment in specifically the backend folder. You can do the command
python -m venv venv to make it. 
It is gitignored so you only need to do this once. This is just good practice to prevent dependencies from using or messing up
with global dependencies


2. Now run .\venv\Scripts\Activate to activate the virtual environment. You know it will work if you
see (venv) in front of your terminal directory


3. Now in the same backend directory, run pip install -r .\requirements.txt to get all the dependencies on the project


4. You should be set, now run python ./main.py to run the FastAPI call. Afterwards, enter the http://localhost:8000/static/home.html link to start on the home page.
